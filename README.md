# TFG

This is an experiment to create a cross platform 3d app for windows, osx, ios and android without the use of any cross platform framework.  It is written in C++ and accesses the native libraries of each platform directly.  The result is a very small, high performance application which starts extremely quickly.  Build times are also extremely fast.
